Сказка 1:
Once upon a time, there was a tiny hedgehog named Sonic. He had a mischievous and affectionable spirit, and he loved exploring new places and adventures. One day, Sonic decided to take a walk in the woods, feeling adventurous and ready for any challenges that life had in store. 

As Sonic trekked deeper into the jungle, he soon stumbled upon a glowing stone headstone in the heart of the ancient forest. It was the guide to a hidden valley, filled with ancient plants and a bountiful harvest of berries and nuts. Sonic touched the stone, and a gentle breeze carried the scent of the mystical fruit to his ears.

 drivelling cautiously, Sonic explored the narrow vine fences. To his relief, he found himself in a small, cozy hut made from remnants of an ancient monarchy. The hut housed a unique indoor garden where the materialateur carefully transformed a storm of pink and yellow hues into edible fruits that the inhabitants of the valley could enjoy.

As Sonic munching on the delicious fruits, his curiosity piqued. He tossed some celots to the villagers outside. "Now," he said, "this should turn you into trees yourself, not pests!" The other villagers giggled as they returned the delicious tokens to their child. 

Sonic decided to be kind and invite the villagers to come sleep under his blanket. In addition to the refreshing and delicious berries, everyone sang and danced under the lanterns. 

Three years went by, and the villagers were all the better for Sonic's kindness. However, they noticed that his reputation as a wise old hedgehog seemed to be in danger, considering the unusual actions he took in the forest. Fears of Sonic continuously emerging from the shadows and beginning mischief started to gnaw at the villagers' complacency.

Meanwhile, Sonic, ever the prankster, began to spot Andry, a mischievous orangutan riding alone along the treeline. Sonic decided that Andry must have heard the cute low whistle from the hedgehog at the vicar's house earlier. He sparkled a tiny feather with a mischievous glint and ran like a baby squirrel to chant. This disturbed Andry, who chased the hedgehog back at gunpoint.

Faced with the pervasive thug, the villagers organized a powerful and devastating parade for Sonic. They welcomed and fed the hedgehog, carrying him through calm crowds. People cheered for the cunning and benevolent hedgehog, and in a rare agreement, each individual gave strides in support. 

Sonic, finding that his little tribe shares his beliefs about spreading kindness, decided to embark on a grand adventure to reunite with his village. Funds from the neighborhood returned for Sonic's treat. He traveled over, resolute and inspiring. After much struggle, he realized that he had only found a lonely rose amidst special endpapers worth more than the high rewards part of the field trip. 

Now, Sonic is a cultivator who has awakened his past self, transforming what hapenred into a vivid, vibrant lineage of changes that fuel his actions today. Hoping through the node of the present day, he dreams of far more adventures, enduring the trials, and finding friendship, pride in a wide swath of the shadows of the world.

Сказка 2:
Once upon a time in the wilds of the Whispering Woods, there lived a small, cute hedgehog named Sonic. Despite being just a tiny creature, Sonic had a peculiar love for exploring the woods by exploring toys that had been left behind by other inhabitants. 

On a crisp autumn morning, Sonic set off by herself into the woods, her confidence basking in the freedom of her unique species. A decomposing log buried beneath the forest floor made all the more exciting as she named it Vox, after her favorite toy from the Xero series of indoor LEGO Lego Wallpapers.

As Sonic ventured further into the woods, she encountered King Cat. He was a king, tall and commanding, with a boner and a signature grin that was etched into his face. Sonic found King Cat's attic, its halls lined with musty and crumpled blankets. These maps were a curious showcase of ancient maps, marking where various sections of this ancient castle had been.

Without knocking, Sonic ventured inside to help King Cat. Foam with art compositions on it instantly climbing out from within made the dust fly everywhere. "Hey, this art? Umadaw wow, where did you learn it?"

"A tiny art form on a log? Lollipop x-ray!" Sonic exclaimed. She exclaimed, pulling a broken, cracked bubble from within the log for her makeshift vials. Then, she stretched her member and scratched inside, causing King Cat a puffy, cuddly, ego-sucking brain from his rosy cheeks.

Encouraging her to try and use her keenest sense of scent, Vic already had his scent stack in hand. "Ambrosia, acne from the dusty cellars, yes Dasadas as usual," Sonic debated. Then, Victoire, his female partner, came past her offspring with a jar filled with translucent halobacterium. No, Sonic almost laughed before chuckling more. "Moz-fu, a disgust from the hermit grooves," she sighed. And there was Epic Leacon's ubiquity-enslavened holographic landing where Sonic curled and positioned herself. Annoyed, "And your借此落态のがべる、Descriptor道元褓はエニウジウム鯨だ王クラス星王...

"That George," Sonic gasped. She flushed up from the discomfort感 then quickly relaxed, her cheeks haggling wider. The necklace was perfect. The next morning, Sonic trickled champagne a dash into the log to explain her fermentation past for vanity. She also taught one of the tree named Chevy, who lived in the caves, a regolith dish of the log's ashes.

After the newfound intellect, Sonic now regarded the other creatures with newfound respect. Inver Yellow Jack, his first and current lively friend, was always eager to practice combing the chestnut log's humionmarshal of Clayton, Singh, and Capalog. While they all agreed they would practice anyway, something different about this punk pirate was swimming inside her.

As she remained quiet in the dark-lidded darkest part of the woods, a voice chime for what?) Sonic did not quite remember. Then, Cassandra, her trusted mutual-friend, hurried over. "Sarah, I dreams she starts to whistle xie prizers! Um, it starts for the red candy"? She said, revealing how they look like coarse candy to Saxrophone. Sonic blushed just a little nigh a blush, but felt a sense of safety.

Her pet reinterpret technique was much more socially insensitive to her entity but incorporated a humorous twist to add an edge. But her most embarrassing was that she kissed the hatchet in a "tigon—gatom—graft" form. She released a tripple-laughing, aura-immulating bite into Dominic's belly with a taste ofblood, shading all her tangerine bent lips deftly.

With the snooping, jokes, lewd escapades and toys for fun, Sonic's insomniaca ritual had caused her tales of why quick, quirky, and curious night-time feellines pley too only into the sunrise. Thus, she rarely felt a need to poke fun at caves, caves or caves at night in the dark caused by quick debates on shifts between the girlfriend radiuses are a complete waste...

Through these tunnels 8 discovers the man, Bromfush, who obviously was oblivious to the voguish existence of sage palates and the curdles in lilliputian art! But, she was on quest to help Sonic and Los Nos! To frame this story it was motivated mainly by existing within economic, uhupsiring of the deep wisdom of the answer, helping herself and Sonic amoush. END

Сказка 3:
Once upon a time, in a small village nestled among the rolling hills, there lived a curious and tiny hedgehog named Sonic. Known for his size and the few whiskers that twitched to indicate his presence, Sonic spent his days exploring the dense forest around his home. He had a keen sense of smell and an interest in the wild creatures and plants they effortlessly surrounded him.

Sonic's world was anything but ordinary. He spent most of his days watching the weather, ensuring that the forest always had clear skies. He found joy in the winter's chill, yearning for the warmth and comfort of sunlight. In the summer, he leaped through fields with a belly button as big as a banana, stretching his lithe body out as far as he could to catch insects that soared through the air.

One sunny afternoon, while lounging on a moss-covered rock overlooking the valley below, Sonic grabbed a deep breath, his ears perking up to listen. Suddenly, he stumbled, land on his hind legs, and teetered over the edge. A sudden gust of wind blew over him, sending him sprawling back down. Surprised, Sonic stared in amazement at the fall of a nearby branch. Seeing the fresh green leaves and delicate branches below, he realized he had made a tiny mistake.

Overjoyed, Sonic rushed over to the freshly fallen trinket, his wide lipped marsupial eyes wide in amusement. From the box that held it, he plucked an olive green, one shrew-sized catnip, and straightened into shape. He eagerly hid it behind his ear, wishing he could play with it all day and smile for all time.

With his newfound excitement, Sonic calmed his frantic tail, stretched it out, and limped with the catnip tightly wedged between his toes. Mama and Papa sponsored the day's budget and make-up of ensuring his orange fur sparkled and showed off with a well-defined expression, splashing thrift-shoppers over with the miraculous satisfaction that had arrived after a perfect street-lit battle.

Sonic couldn't wait to shock the kids in the neighborhood and take everyone stumped by his catnip bun before the first movie night. As he still hid in the poppet, he knew he could finally take on the world off his wag. As the game ended in a draw, he slid down the rattlesnake’s leg to see what Spike was doing, still muddling for his life---just grasping at hope even though his catnip was a bit ahead.

Once upon a time, in a small hutch nestled within the sleepy rolling hills of the dense vineyard, there lived an adorable creature named Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic was hermit-like in appearance, with soft brown fur that curled up at the tips and a fondness for keeping his nose in the flap of his diaper to allow for optimal ventilation.

Sonic was the pride of a green meadow, and everyone came to idly watch his humble dwelling as a potent liaison between the environmental and heroistic worlds. When not content in his idyllic abode, Sonic would venture out into the unfamiliar countryside where his life came to an abrupt end. He often vented his frustrations through his nightly lapses into a small, cozy, and rustic den in the barn.

One fateful night, while wandering through a hidden stream, Sonic came face to face with the ever-present pleasure of at last being freed from his mundane existence. As a gentle breeze rustled through the fields, a merry bonfire was lit up by a cheerful lad named Zinkley who had been tuning instruments before a brilliant idea sprang from his heart. He proposed to make Sonic the curtain stand by a famous alpine spire for a brief performance of the art of loud magot, setting the stage for a wild adventure.

Inside Zinkley, Sonic observed that the spire was adorned with dauntless silhouettes of anonymous figures, some blazed to their termination with alarms of upward innovation. The moment he stepped inside, London - the canopy of the altipl lapse - woke up and morphed into Sonic the Hedgehog’s handsome presence as following instructions of Zinkley, Sonic climbed up the apparatus.

Their first adventure didn’t fail; as hugged by light and angered, Sonic staggered madly around the circular box, but with amusement, he begun to advance with greater speed. Zinkley watching the bewildered pilot’s soaring daydreams into the void, chirped and raised the fate-capturing horn of an ominous instrument of chaotic dispersal.

As the whistle departs, Sonic cleverly continues, transforming the atmosphere into an articulate, city-gazing song of unfolding madness. Desperation and courage tread loose, muffling a bloody alpine theater where enemies and fans alike gathered. In time, the crowd is swept from a quiet room to a jubilant celebration; Zinkley is cornered but unmoved as Sonic rides the surge of sympathy on the edge of the spire. Lead-sans-such talents galore gleam at the spire, clearly surviving.

After a long day of amusing him before a dying race and also during a violence of the race’s foundations, Sonic and Zinkley realize the importance of their engagement in the chaos they heard first. In the fading light, Sonic speaks to Zinkley. This leads to a magic moment as Sonic finds himself stroking that frosted horn that Zinkley is singing while it’s the (quiet) sound of a shockwave’s bereft sonic boom.

The two, in identity seconds, each bear joyfully to an alpine festival of redemption and appreciation. Sonic the Hedgehog’s whispered proclamation, in the dream world, brings a silken band of change as he confronts a stutter with the sound of leaving forever’s streets in a sound of broken balls, turning Zinkley into silent wilder, harmonizing with the perpetual music. His fate-possessed brides nestled by the hutch just now have climbed up to be matter of the world as well, for both them more aware changed minds than canon knowledge. Our futuristic England was once written as nostalgia, but together, it’s a story about potential, today, and the choice of gift for the future.<|im_end|>

Задача 4. Nucleus Sampling

Как отличаются генерации:	
Температура 1.0	Top-p 0.9	Наиболее разнообразный текст, иногда хаотичный
Температура 1.0	Top-p 0.15	Почти жадный (greedy), короткие и шаблонные фразы
Температура 0.5	Top-p 0.9	Сбалансированное разнообразие, структура чаще сохраняется
Температура 0.5	Top-p 0.15	Очень безопасный текст, но может не завершать правильно JSON

Помог ли top-p sampling?
Да, в комбинации с температурой top-p помогает избежать бессмысленных генераций
Особенно полезен для структурированных форматов вроде JSON — реже нарушается формат
Для сказок снижает хаотичность, сохраняя креативность

Sonic was a tiny hedgehog with fluff layers, brown fur, and a small, vibrant face. He lived in a small, cozy hole under a tree, nestled in a dark, rain-soaked forest. Sonic was born and raised in a small village, where he spent his days playing with the other animals and sleeping under the canopy of the trees.

One sunny afternoon, Sonic had a fever. It had been just a cold, but the fever was starting to grow. The villagers thought it was just a bad case of a cold, but Sonic was worried. He had been bitten by a venomous snake that had gotten back at him, and now he was so thin and weak that he couldn't even move.

Sonic's friends were worried about him, but he didn't want to make anyone else feel bad. He had a plan to take the bite out of the snake and heal himself. He dug deep into the ground, the hole under the tree, and started digging around, hoping to find a pinch of earth.

Sonic found an earthworm underground. Using the earthworm's strength, he began to dig, inch by inch, and finally, he found the snake. With great effort, he brought the venomous snake back to the village. He fixed the bite and sent it away, his friends cheered for him.

Over the next few days, Sonic worked tirelessly to recover. He ate healthy foods and did yoga, just like all the other villagers. He spent his days exploring the forest, chasing tiny mice and little bugs, and he slept well at night. Finally, the fever was gone, and he felt better than ever.

Sonic was the most courageous and helpful of the village's creatures. He had rescued a venomous snake, saved a life, and taught others how to help each other. He was loved and appreciated for his bravery and kindness, and he lived happily ever after, a reminder of the power of friendship and the importance of helping others.<|im_end|>
